# CIS*1300 – Introduction to Programming (C)

This repository contains my completed assignments and lab exercises for **CIS*1300: Introduction to Programming** at the University of Guelph. All work is written in **C** and demonstrates my understanding of core programming concepts, including:

- Variables, data types, and control structures
- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays, pointers, and memory management
- File I/O
- Strings and character manipulation
- Dynamic memory management concepts

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders with CIS1300-Intro-to-Programming as the parent folder:
- assignments/ # All 5 course assignments
- labs/ # All 6 lab exercises
- README.md # This file


Each assignment or lab folder contains:

- **Source code (`.c` and `.h` files)** – cleaned and ready to compile
- **Test files (`test_main.c`)** – simple programs demonstrating how to use the functions
- **README.md** – a description of the assignment/lab, challenges, and learning outcomes

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the `assignments` or `labs` folder.
2. Open an individual project/lab folder.
3. Compile the test file with your C compiler.

Example for Assigments:

```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 test_main.c assignmentX_file.c -o test_assignmentX
./test_assignmentX
```
Example for Labs:
```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 main.c lab#.c -o test_lab#
./test_lab#
```

## Key Concepts Learned

Through these assignments and labs, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Writing modular and reusable C code

- Debugging and testing programs

- Using pointers and dynamic memory safely

- Understanding basic algorithm design and analysis

- Reading and manipulating data from files

## Notes

All code is my own work, except where otherwise noted. Private information (student numbers, instructor files) has been removed. Files provided by the instructor for testing or as skeletons have not been included.
