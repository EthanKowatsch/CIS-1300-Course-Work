# Assignment 4 — DNA Analysis Program

## Overview
This assignment focused on building a command-line DNA analysis program in C. Key skills practiced included:

- Working with arrays and pointers
- String and array manipulation
- Modular programming using multiple functions
- Implementing common algorithms: GC-content calculation, motif search, palindrome and anagram detection, and Hamming distance calculation

The program consolidates understanding of function design, pointer usage, and modular code structure.

## Topics Learned
- Arrays and pointers
- String manipulation
- Function design and modular programming
- Loops and conditionals
- Edge-case handling and input validation

## Files
- [Initial C Program](a4_initial.c)
- [Test File](test_main.c)
- [Final C Program](a4_final.c)
- [Header File](a4.h)

## How to Compile
Use the following command to compile the initial program:

```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 a4_initial.c test_main.c -o initial
```
```bash
./initial
```
Use the following command to compile the final program:
```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 a4_final.c test_main.c -o final
```
```bash
./final
```
