# Assignment 5 — Dynamic DNA Database

## Overview
This assignment focused on building a dynamic DNA database program in C. Key skills practiced included:

- Defining and using structs for real-world data
- Reading and parsing CSV files
- Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `realloc`
- Memory management and cleanup using `free`
- Modular program design with multiple cooperating functions

The program loads DNA records from a CSV file into memory and allows analysis and modification of the database dynamically.

## Topics Learned
- Structs and pointers
- Dynamic memory allocation
- File I/O and CSV parsing
- Modular function design
- Edge-case handling and memory management

## Files
- [Header File](a5.h)
- [Functions Implementation File](a5_functions.c)
- [Test File](test_main.c)

## How to Compile
Use the following command to compile the program:

```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 a5_functions.c test_main.c -o a5
```
```bash
./a5
```
