# Assignment 2 — AI Assistant

## Overview
This assignment builds on basic C programming concepts to create a simple command-line AI assistant called **Gryphon.AI**. The focus is on managing internal state, processing user commands, implementing input validation, and using conditionals and switch statements effectively. Peer programming and AI-assisted code review are also incorporated to encourage good coding practices and critical thinking.

## Topics Learned
- Variable declaration and initialization (`int`, `float`, `char`)
- Constants and code readability (`const`)
- User input with `scanf` and validation loops
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Conditional logic with `if`, `else if`, and `else`
- `switch` statements for menu-based command processing
- Peer programming and code review
- Writing clean, readable, and well-commented C code

## Files
- [Initial C Program](a2_initial.c)
- [Final C Program](a2_final.c)

## How to Compile
Use the following command to compile the initial program:

```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 a2_initial.c -o initial
```
```bash
./initial
```

Use the following command to compile the final program:
```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 a2_final.c -o final
```
```bash
./final
```
